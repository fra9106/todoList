Project basis #8 : Improve an existing project 

# Preamble
You can intervene on the project at any time to offer new functionalities or
why not new implementations which would serve to make the code evolve in a relevant way.
# Install project on your machine:
```
To do this, go to : https://github.com/fra9106/todoList and Fork it 
```
# Path to follow :
```
- Open a new issue
```
```
- Suggest your issue 
```
 # After acceptance from us : 
```
- create a new branch, so you can work on it 
- start implementing your code
- commit it
```
```
- Create a new pull-request and suggest it to us
```
If the code is suitable and functional you will be able to merge your new functionality
# Some rules :
```
- Respect PSR 1 and 2
- Your code must be clear and readable
- Written with a PHP version identical to the project
- And above all your code must be reusable
- For the quality of the code, use the CODACY tool
- Test your code 
- have fun!
